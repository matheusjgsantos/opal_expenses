# opal_expenses
Data Extraction and transformation from NSW Opal expenses report

 This is my first Python project, therefore expect a lot on incongruences and no designing patterns at all.
 The opa_expenses.py should open a windows with file selection and other options. You may select your OPAL report file generated from the https://www.opal.com.au/ site, import it into a nice table and generate output files with the information you need as excel, pdf or csv.
 This is a WIP. At this moment the program only imports the file and output the content to the console.

How to use:

 MAC OSX: you will need python 2.6/2.7, PDFMiner and xlwt

$ pip install pdfminer

$ pip install xlwt

 Windows: Not tested yet. TBA soon
